# kNN_Regression
The following Notebook was created to learn how a kNN regression algorithm is built and evaluated. Throughout the Notebook I have explained each step and evaluated any output my model has produced. Everything in this Notebook is my own work.

I will be looking into what factors that affect happiness in OECD countries. I will be using a kNN regression model to find correlations between the response variable 'Life Ladder' and our WHRData dataset predictors while evaluating how well our model fits the data.
